# chatproject

chatproject is a Telegram chat data visualizer, which outputs graphs both in vector formats and in HTML files as to not lose pictographical quality.

## Usage

After exporting the chat data in .json format from the desktop app, place the result.json file in the chatproject folder. Then run the script and the media files will be output to that same directory.
